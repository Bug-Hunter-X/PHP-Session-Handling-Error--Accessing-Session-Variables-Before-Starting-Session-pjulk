The solution involves starting the session using `session_start()` before attempting to access or modify session variables.

```php
<?php
// Start the session
session_start();

// Check if the username session variable exists
if (isset($_SESSION['username'])) {
    echo "Your username is: " . $_SESSION['username'];
} else {
    echo "Session variable 'username' is not set.";
}
?>
```

This corrected version first initializes the session using `session_start()`, ensuring that the session is properly started before attempting to access `$_SESSION['username']`. The addition of `isset()` ensures that we only access the variable if it has been previously set, preventing notices or errors.
